	* 2015-05-26 [BUGFIX|FEATURE] Support for mountpoints
	* 2015-05-26 [TASK] Update version number, update documentation, add changelog

There have been some issues with mountpoints. There can be wrong entries in your tx_realurl_pathcache table because of
this! This release fixes them. But I had to refactor a lot, so  if you are using Signals/Slots there could be breaking
changes. Test carefully!

There is still one open TODO: Test, what happens when there are nested mountpoints.
